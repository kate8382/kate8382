# Hello! 👋 My name is Ekaterina (Kate)

I am a junior web developer passionate about creating modern and user-friendly interfaces. Coming from a non-IT background, I have been fully dedicated to learning web development since August 2023, completing courses and building projects to strengthen my skills to become a PRO Frontend Developer. Under the guidance of Skillbox mentors, I completed the **Basic Web Development** and **Basic JavaScript** courses with final projects. Currently, I am independently studying **Advanced JavaScript**. Here's a little about me:

- 🌱 Planning to learn: **TypeScript, Node.js, React, Vue**.
- 💼 Looking for opportunities to work in frontend development, as I believe practice is the best teacher.
- 📫 Contact me: [e.sevciuc82@gmail.com](mailto:e.sevciuc82@gmail.com).

## 🛠️ My Skills:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+).
- Version control systems: Git, GitHub, GitLab.

## 📂 My Projects:
- [V-Wave Radio](https://github.com/kate8382/w-vawe_radio) — final project of a web page.
- [Frontend-Pro](https://github.com/kate8382/frontend-pro) — final project of a CRM system, including a [Frontend-module](https://github.com/kate8382/frontend-module) — an interface module for a CRM web application, developed by me.

## 📒 My Practical Works:
- [To-Do App](https://github.com/kate8382/to-do_app) — a practical project to practice **arrays, DOM manipulation, and event handling**. Also, I explored **Node.js** by configuring `eslint.config.json` and adapting the `package.json` file initially set up for GitLab.
- [Memory Game](https://github.com/kate8382/memory_game) — a practical project on **constants, scope, and closures**. The process was very exciting! 😊
- [Students List](https://github.com/kate8382/students_list) — a student management application that allows adding, deleting, sorting, and filtering students. This project focuses on working with a server and using **type-transform** to manage and display data in a table format.
- [Guess Number Game](https://github.com/kate8382/guess_number_game) — a practical project to explore **browser events** and **execution context**. This game challenges users to guess a number within a minute, with limited attempts and hints. This project was completed during my self-study journey.

## 🌟 My Goals:
- Deepen my knowledge in web development.
- Build a portfolio with 5+ high-quality projects.
- Find a job in frontend development.
