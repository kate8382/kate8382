Hi â€” I'm Ecaterina (Katya) ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Junior Frontend Developer who builds production-ready web apps. I focus on modern JavaScript, robust tooling and automated testing. I enjoy turning UX ideas into reliable, maintainable interfaces.

## What I do
- Build responsive, accessible UIs with HTML, CSS and modern JavaScript (ES6+).
- Create SPA flows and modular client-side architecture with Webpack and Babel.
- Implement automated tests and CI: unit tests (Jest) and end-to-end tests (Cypress).
- Work with Node.js for tooling, scripts and simple backends.

## Tooling & Testing
- Node.js, npm/yarn, Webpack, Babel
- Jest (unit), Cypress (e2e), ESLint, Sass, style-loader / mini-css-extract
- Chart.js, redom, core-js, regenerator-runtime (runtime & small libraries)

## Featured pet projects
- [error-logger-viewer](https://kate8382.github.io/error-logger-viewer/) â€” pet project: SPA for collecting, grouping and analyzing JavaScript errors.
  Built with Webpack, Node.js backend (LowDB), tested with Jest + Cypress, served via a static build.
  (Features: global error collection, filters, charts, modal editing, CI with GitHub Actions.)

## Projects
- [Vâ€‘Wave Radio](https://kate8382.github.io/w-vawe_radio/) â€” final HTML/CSS project (pixelâ€‘perfect, responsive).
- [Frontendâ€‘Pro](https://github.com/kate8382/frontend-pro/) â€” CRM final project (including a [Frontend-module](https://kate8382.github.io/frontend-module/)).

## Practical works
- [Toâ€‘Do App](https://kate8382.github.io/to-do_app/) â€” modular SPA with hybrid API/localStorage and hash navigation.
  - The UI is built with Bootstrap 5 for a modern and responsive design.
  - Project is modular (UI/API) and supports offline mode via localStorage.
  - Demonstrates async operations (fetch/async-await) and robust error handling.
- [Students List](https://kate8382.github.io/students_list/) â€” app with server-backed JSON storage and table operations.
  - Modern JS (ES6+), Bootstrap 5 UI, Node.js backend for JSON storage.
  - Demonstrates add/delete/sort/filter operations, async fetch, error handling and modular architecture.
- [Memory Game](https://kate8382.github.io/memory_game/) â€” practical exercise on constants, scope and closures.
- [Guess Number Game](https://kate8382.github.io/guess_number_game/) â€” practical exercise on events, timing and simple OOP.

## ðŸŒŸ My Goals
- Continue learning TypeScript, React and Node.js
- Build a strong portfolio and find a frontend role where I can grow.
