# Hello! 👋 My name is Ekaterina (Kate)

I am a junior web developer passionate about creating modern and user-friendly interfaces. Since August 2023, I have been studying to become a PRO Frontend Developer. Under the guidance of Skillbox mentors, I completed the **Basic Web Development** and **Basic JavaScript** courses with final projects. Currently, I am independently studying **Advanced JavaScript**. Here's a little about me:

- 🌱 Planning to learn: **TypeScript, Node.js, React, Vue**.
- 💼 Looking for opportunities to work in frontend development, as I believe practice is the best teacher.

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+).
